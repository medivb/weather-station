# weather-station
A weather station measuring ambient light, motion, temperature, humidity and air quality using an ESP32 via ESPHome on Home Assistant

I started this project just to get some feeling for what I could do with ESP Home and some cheap sensors from the various Chinese webshops. So far I am really impressed with all the possibilities and although I am not a programmer, scripting stuff through ESP Home, statistics and template sensors in Home Assistant got me very far.
